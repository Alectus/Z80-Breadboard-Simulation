# Z80-Breadboard-Simulation
This is an attempt to simulate Ben Eaters very well documentated 8-bit breadboard project on Simulide and is still under construction.

See the original at https://eater.net/8bit and his video playlist :

and his GitHub page for programming the Eeproms: https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer

Pictures of my simulations are included and also .simu files which can be downloaded and can be run on your own Simulide software if you so please.
My software version is Simulide 0.4.14-SR4 Windows64. The Simulide software can be downloaded here:

Halfway through I noticed there is no Z80 in this project.
The easiest way to make sense of my messy repository is to sort it by date and read the enclosed txt-files and compare it to Ben's original project.
There is also a Tweakers topic available in  Dutch : https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/2043958/0 
And I want to thank Arcachofo for his great help and support where you can read about here and it might also be usefull to read it in case you have not yet 'upgraded' the 74HC173_LS.package in your Simulide software: https://simulide.forumotion.com/t99-ram-and-74hc670-and-74xx170#507
The final file in this repository is Bus loop completed (13-02-2021).

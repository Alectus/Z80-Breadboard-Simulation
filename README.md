# Z80-Breadboard-Simulation
This is an attempt to simulate Ben Eaters Z80 breadboard project on Simulide and is still under construction.
See the original at https://eater.net/8bit and his video playlist https://github.com/Alectus/Z80-Breadboard-Simulation/edit/main/README.md 

Pictures of my simulations will be included and files which can be downloaded and can be run on your own Simulide software if you so please.
My software version is Simulide 0.4.14-SR4 Windows64. The Simulide software can be downloaded here:

Halfway through I noticed there is no Z80 in this project.
The easiest way to figure out the steps I took is to sort it by date and read the enclosed txt-file(s) and compare it to Ben's original project.
